## Whatsapp Chat Analyser


WhatsApp is one of the most used and efficient method of communication in today's world. 
WhatsApp chats consists of various kinds of conversations held among group of people. This chat consists of various topics. This information can provide lots of data for latest technologies such as machine learning. 
This tool aims to provide in depth analysis of this data which is provided by WhatsApp. Our developed code can be applied to obtain a better understanding of the data. 

Our tool is implemented using various new-age python modules such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and algorithms like sentiment analysis - to create data frames and plot different graphs. It is then deployed using streamlit.

There are certain concerns related to the exponentially increasing usage of WhatsApp and some of them are mentioned below. The aim of our project is to minimise the negative impacts of these limitations.

- Excessive daily usage - Whatsapp claims that nearly 55 billion messages are sent each day. The average user spends 195 minutes per week on Whatsapp, and is a member of plenty of groups.
- Distracting messages - Due to constant alerts from spam/unimportant messages, productivity is largely reduced. This negatively affects businesses, as employees lose focus and productivity.
- Security concerns - Given the large number of links that are circulated over whatsapp everyday, customers become vulnerable to frauds and security breaches. 
- Socially disruptive - Customers are often unaware of the social disruptions they go through due to whatsapp
